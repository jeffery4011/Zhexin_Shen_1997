This project focus on applying single-photon-counting & imaging techinques on ranging & drawing trajectories of different satellites. The equipments we used are shown below.

We also designed an algorithm that distinguishes signals from noises as well as controls the emitterâ€™s motors which ensures a constant following with target satellite.
