  Mixed aerial and ground robot teaming, which involves ground vehicles (UGV) and unmanned aerialvehicles (UAVs), is widely used for ground criminal chasing,precise agriculture, and natural disaster rescue. 
  However, robot proficiency is different from each other that ground and aerialrobots are different in motion speed, perceiving range, and reaching area, and even tolerance to environment conditions. With the heterogeneous capabilities of robotsâ€™, it brings challenges of controlling as well as maximally exploiting a group of different robots. 
  Therefore, to address this challenge for effective ground and aerial teaming, this paper developed a pro-ficiency aware multi-agent deep reinforcement learning  (mix-RL) method to guide mixed teaming by adapting to capability difference of robot and task requirements.

We use Gazebo to simulate the environment of Kent State University Student Center, University Library and Risman Plaza which includes diffenet conditions such as forests, buildings and plaza.

We use three different kinds of vehicles in our simulation and each of them has distinct capabilities. 
* Firefly has redundant 6-rotor propulsion system which is very robust and guarantees broad perception. 
* Iris is a quad-copter. It moves faster but has a relative small range of perception. 
* Husky is a UGV with slow velocity.

We use a target-pursuing scenario as the task of our mixed team. The robots are seperated into two teams. Police(Blue) includes three different types of robots and its goal is to capture Criminal(Red). The criminal can also learn from each episode, thus we train our model with an adversarial training method.

After training, the mixed team has a substaintial improvement compared with MADRL(without proficiency awareness) providing theoretical support for real-world teaming of aerial and ground robot deployment.
